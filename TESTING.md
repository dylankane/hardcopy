# Testing

Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.

Below I have outlined the different tests I have undertaken on this project to prove its robustness.

## Browser Compatibility

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various browsers.

Consider testing at least 3 different browsers, if available on your system.

Recommended browsers to consider:
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox (Developer Edition)](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/download)
- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download)

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested browsers, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Please note, there are services out there that can test multiple browser compatibilities at the same time.
Some of these are paid services, but some are free.
If you use these, you must provide a link to the source used for attribution, and multiple screenshots of the results.

Sample browser testing documentation:

üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë END OF NOTES (to be deleted) üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Browser | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/browser-chrome.png) | Works as expected |
| Firefox | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/browser-firefox.png) | Works as expected |
| Edge | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/browser-edge2.png) | Works as expected |

## Responsiveness

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various device sizes.

The minimum requirement is for the following 3 tests:
- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested responsiveness, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Using the "amiresponsive" mockup image (or similar) does not suffice the requirements.
Consider using some of the built-in device sizes in the Developer Tools.

If you have tested the project on your actual mobile phone or tablet, consider also including screenshots of these as well.
It showcases a higher level of manual tests, and can be seen as a positive inclusion!

## Lighthouse Audit

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.

If you don't have Lighthouse in your Developer Tools,
it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Don't just test the home page (unless it's a single-page application).
Make sure to test the Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Sample Lighthouse testing documentation:

üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë END OF NOTES (to be deleted) üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

## Defensive Programming

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important!

When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each.
Examples of this could include (not limited to):

Forms:
- Users cannot submit an empty form
- Users must enter valid email addresses


Flask/Django:
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted page
- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality while logged-out
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers

You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form,
or uses CRUD functionality for data manipulation on a database.
Make sure to include the `required` attribute on any form-fields that should be mandatory.
Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser).

You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

## Bugs

Below is a list of the main and most time consuming bugs I came accross. It is obviously not all the issues I came up against. But most were fixable with a short head scratch or a look through slack and or google. The usual url pathways and redirects gave plenty of errors when developing, and the inevitable typo issues. Or first iterations of a view function might not have the correct logic.

- Error 400 in stripe, making payment intent and charging

    - To fix this, I had to set the port on the local site to public from by gitpod workspace.

- When choosing a genre for a new product in the add_product form, the none option was not available

    - To fix this, I had to add it in as an option in the form class. As the form had a function to get the friendly name of the genres and categories, this removed the default none option. With a lot of trial and error and soe ideas from my mentor, I figured how and where to append the none option to the choices, in the genre field.

- HTML vlaidation on any html page that had a link to the artist filter. The link was been called in a django template tag ```{{ product.artist }}```
which was picking up the spaces in the artist names. Still worked but failed html validation.

    - To fix this, I I tried adding a function to the model to create a url friendly version of the artist, that did work in some places, but not where it was being called from a queryset of a flat list of artists. Eventually finding the solution in stack overflow. Adding |urlencode to the template tag like this  ```{{ product.artist|urlencode }}```

- Wishlist button on the product list. Button would add or remove the item to list. However I couldnt get the button on the page to change appropriately. Either thay all stayed unmarked all they all changed to solid.

    - To fix this, I made a few minor changes to the view function controlling the button logic. The main thing that sorted it out was fixing the redirect url call. By using redirect and parameter and not just render.

- Deleting a product not working

    - To fix this, I found I was missing a trailing slash in the url.

- Getting a working add to cart button on the product list. Was working from the product detail page. 

    - To fix this, I used ```{% url ‚Äòadd_to-bag‚Äô %}?source=‚Äôshop‚Äô  ``` as a way to handle the view being called form other places and redirecting where the link was clicked and setting a hidden quantity of 1 so the quantity selector didnt have to be present on the product card.

- Reviews app, could not get the form data to render in the product detail template in the shop app.

    - To fix this, I kept the form in its own html template in the reviews app, and the view for displaying the reviews places in the in the shop app.

- A similar problem to the last one, was getting the newsletter form to render its fields on the footer on every page. This form also coming from its own app.

    - To fix this, with some help (from tutor support) I realised a context processor is what was needed to get the form available across the whole site

- Product images were not showing, when I had deplaoyed and added my nedia files to the aws s3 bucket.

    - To fix this, I had to make changes to my fixture file of all the products and re load data to the database. And change the image pathways accross the code. Initially I had set up the images in the fixture with a pathway to the media folder and then the image file name, and on the templates was calling it the same way. I needed to remove the folder call on the image field in the fixture, and then I changed the template image path to call the image url instead.




## Unfixed Bugs

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë END OF NOTES (to be deleted) üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

If you legitimately cannot find any unfixed bugs or warnings, then use the following sentence:

üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë END OF NOTES (to be deleted) üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
