            <p>
                The store was set up and launched by Frank and Tom, two life long listeners, lovers and collectors of vinyl records.
                With experience in retail and audio engineering, between them they made the perfect business partners to take on this project. 
                With their passion for vinyl, they wanted to make a one stop shop for anyone else sharing that love or people 
                looking to start their vinyl journey for their frst time. They have an eclectic taste for music, and wanted the store to represent that.
